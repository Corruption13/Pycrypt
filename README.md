# Pycrypt - V 1: Enigma
Cross Platform Encryption Application


## ATTENTION STALKER!

I made this project while I was learning Programming, therefore its filled with spaghetti code and god aweful code design.
The only reason I haven't nuked this repository is for personal nostalgia's sake, and to see how far I have progressed years later.
Please do not over analyse or attempt to understand my code, 


Also I know the aesthetics are vomitous, I was just trying to be a hipster. Material Design is overrated and unoriginal. 

K thanks bye.
